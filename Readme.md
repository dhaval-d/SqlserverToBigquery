This is a sample Dataflow application that copies data from Sql server table to Bigquery table. 

This application assumes following:
<ul>
<li>BigQuery table has a same schema as Sql server table.
<li>BigQuery table already exists before running this pipeline.
<li>User has required permissions to Sql server database(read) as well as GCP project.
<li>***PLEASE NOTE***: THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE PROJECT AND COMES WITH NO WARRANTIES.
</ul>
